Conversion Reactor
------------------

The **Conversion Reactor** is used to calculate the mole fraction of components at outlet stream when the conversion of base component for the reaction is defined.

The conversion reactor model have following connection ports:

 * Two Material Streams: feed and outlet stream
 * One Energy Stream: heat added

To simulate a conversion reactor, following calculation parameters must be provided:

 - Calculation Mode ``CalcMode``
 - Outlet Temperature ``Tdef`` (If calculation mode is Define_Out_Temperature)
 - Number of Reactions ``Nr``
 - Base Component ``BC_r``
 - Stoichiometric Coefficient of Components in Reaction ``Coef_cr``
 - Conversion of Base Component ``X_r``
 - Pressure Drop ``Pdel``

All the above variables are of type parameter Real except the first one (CalcMode) which is of type parameter String. It can have either of the sting values among following:

 - ``Isothermal``: If the reactor is operated isothermally
 - ``Define_Out_Temperature``: If the reactor is operated at specified outlet temperature
 - ``Adiabatic``: If the reactor is operated adiabatically

During simulation, their values can specified directly under ``Reactor Specifications`` by double clicking on the reactor model instance.

Below listed points are the step by step explaination as to how to create and simulate this conversion reactor example.

 1. Create a package named ``ConversionReactor``.

 2. Create a model named ``MS`` inside ``ConversionReactor``. This is to extend ``MaterialStream`` model.

 3. Extend the model ``MaterialStream`` and necessary property method from ``ThermodynamicPackages`` ::

		extends Simulator.Streams.MaterialStream;
