OMChemSim's documentation!
=====================================

Welcome to **OMChemSim** - OpenModelica Chemical Simulator.

OMChemSim is a library of chemical system component models written in the Modelica language 
that can be used for chemical process simulations, such as creating binary phase envelopes, 
simulating a process plant flowsheet.

This documentation is the main source of information for **users** and **developers** working with (or contributing to) the **OMChemSim** project.
